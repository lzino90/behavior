Code and data used in the paper "Modelling epidemic dynamics under collective decision making"

INSTRUCTIONS AND SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:

The code for the simulation is written in MATLAB, using version 2019b and requires no add-ons. All the functions needed are included in the corresponding folders. Hence, to run the code it is sufficient to open the corresponding folder with MATLAB.

Both MATLAB and Excel code has been tested on a PC with 16GB RAM and CPU 1.9 GHz with OS Windows 10 (64-bit). The run time of a simulation with n=10,000 individuals and T=600 time-steps is approximately 1000, 600, and 900 seconds for the SIS, SIR, and SEIR models, respectively.

ORGANIZATION:

The repository contains five folders: one for each of the three epidemic model (SIS, SIR, SEIR), and one that contains the raw data of all the figures, and one that contains a demonstration of the output of a similations and the script used to generate it. To run it, it is sufficient to open the folder with MATLAB and run "plot_graph_dynamics_example.m". The run tume is of few second on a standard PC.

The folders sis, sir, and seir contain the code to simulate the SIS, SIR, and SEIR epidemic process coupled with the coevolutionary model, respectively. They also contain the scripts used to generate the corresponding figures in the paper, that is, Figure % (or the panel * of figure %) can be generated by running the file "code_for_fig#.m" or "code_for_fig%_a.m."

The folder "raw_data_figures" contains all the .tex files used to generate the figures in the paper

DEMO

The folder "Demo" contains a sample output of the simulation in the file "demo_output" and the code use to generate it. To run it, it is sufficient to open the folder with MATLAB and run "code_for_demo.m". The run tume is of 1000 second on a standard PC.

LICENCE
Our code has no custom licence, just requires a standard MATLAB licence to run.
